# Bulk File Renamer with Tkinter

## Description
This Python tool provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to rename multiple files in a directory. The user can specify a prefix, starting number, and an optional file extension to filter and rename files in bulk. It's particularly useful for IT managers or anyone dealing with large sets of files needing to be renamed systematically.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: Built with Tkinter for easy interaction. No need for command-line operations.
- **Custom Prefix**: Allows the user to define a prefix for the renamed files.
- **Starting Number**: The user can choose the starting number for the renamed files.
- **Optional File Extension**: The tool can filter files by extension (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`).
- **Batch Renaming**: Renames all files in the selected directory in bulk.
